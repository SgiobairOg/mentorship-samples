      viewBox sets the artboard you're working with. The value defines a pair of
  coordinates on an imaginary grid system with origin 0,0. In this case, we're
  defining an artboard as the rectangle between (15,5) and (80,30).

      The coordinates are somewhat arbitrary but your paths will be based on
  the same 0,0 point. In our case we're using this to our advantage to clip
  the paths where we want them.

      -->
      <path class="smallTriangle t1" d="M0 0 L55 20 L110 0 Z" />
      <!--

      d here defines the drawing coordinates for the path. The string defines
  instructions for how to move and use the 'pen'. In this case: "Move to 0,0.
  Draw a line to 55,20. Draw a line to 110,0. Draw a line back to origin.

      -->
      <path class="smallTriangle t2" d="M0 0 L55 20 L110 0 Z" />
      <path class="smallTriangle t3" d="M0 0 L55 20 L110 0 Z" />

      <!--

      The three paths stack, t1 is on the bottom, t2, then t3.
